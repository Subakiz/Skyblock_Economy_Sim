# Enhanced Market Pipeline Features

This document describes the comprehensive market pipeline fixes implemented to resolve the end-to-end data flow issues.

## Problem Summary

The system was experiencing several critical issues:
- `/plot` commands returned "No bazaar data found" despite data being present
- `/market_pulse` and `/analyze` commands were missing
- No snipes were being sent due to missing feature summaries
- Feature ingestor wasn't running or writing summaries properly
- Environment variables weren't being properly loaded for background processes

## Solution Overview

A comprehensive fix was implemented addressing:

### A) Ingestion & Features Pipeline
- **Enhanced Environment Loading**: Added `.env` file support with defense-in-depth loading
- **Improved Start Script**: Fixed environment variable export for background processes
- **Atomic Summary Writes**: Ensured feature summaries are written atomically every 150 seconds
- **Robust Data Paths**: Configurable feature summaries path with fallback scanning

### B) Enhanced /plot Command
- **4-Level Data Source Fallback**:
  1. Parquet files under `data/bazaar_history/` (highest priority)
  2. Parquet files under `data/bazaar/`
  3. NDJSON file `data/bazaar_snapshots.ndjson`
  4. Live Hypixel API fallback (requires `HYPIXEL_API_KEY`)
- **Flexible Schema Detection**: Handles various column naming conventions
- **Intelligent Error Messages**: Provides detailed search results and suggestions
- **Enhanced Item Matching**: Case-insensitive with alias support

### C) New Commands
- **`/market_pulse`**: Real-time market signals from features and bazaar data
- **`/analyze <item>`**: Comprehensive statistical analysis with z-scores
- **`/diag_features`**: Diagnostics for feature summaries
- **`/diag_bazaar`**: Diagnostics for bazaar data sources  
- **`/diag_env`**: Environment and system diagnostics

## File Changes

### Core Pipeline Files
- `ingestion/feature_ingestor.py`: Added `.env` loading and enhanced interim flush
- `start_bot.sh`: Fixed environment variable export with `set -a`
- `ingestion/feature_consumer.py`: Already had configurable paths (existing)

### New Command Cogs
- `cogs/market_pulse.py`: Market pulse analysis with feature + bazaar signals
- `cogs/analyze.py`: Statistical item analysis with z-scores and insights
- `cogs/diag.py`: Administrative diagnostics for troubleshooting

### Enhanced Existing Files
- `cogs/plot.py`: Completely overhauled data loading with 4-level fallback
- `bot.py`: Added loading of new cogs
- `config/config.yaml`: Already had required configuration

### Testing & Verification
- `scripts/self_test.py`: Comprehensive end-to-end system verification
- `scripts/test_commands.py`: Tests for new command functionality
- `scripts/generate_sample_data.py`: Creates test data for verification

## Usage Examples

### Market Pulse
```
/market_pulse hours:2
```
Returns top trading signals including:
- High spread opportunities (>5%)
- Thin floor alerts for valuable items
- Volume imbalance indicators
- Rising/falling demand patterns

### Enhanced Analysis
```
/analyze item:WHEAT hours:6
```
Provides comprehensive analysis:
- Current mid price, spread, and spread basis points
- Z-scores for price and spread vs. recent history
- Volume imbalance analysis (buy vs sell pressure)
- Trading insights and risk assessment
- Feature data integration when available

### Diagnostics
```
/diag_features    # Check feature summaries status
/diag_bazaar      # Check bazaar data sources
/diag_env         # Check environment and packages
```

## Data Sources Priority

The system now searches data sources in order of reliability:

1. **`data/bazaar_history/` (Parquet)** - Production ingestion output
2. **`data/bazaar/` (Parquet)** - Alternative parquet location
3. **`data/bazaar_snapshots.ndjson`** - NDJSON fallback format
4. **Live Hypixel API** - Real-time fallback (requires API key)

## Error Handling

Enhanced error messages now include:
- Detailed search results showing which sources were checked
- Specific reasons why each source failed (missing files, wrong time window, etc.)
- Item suggestions when exact matches aren't found
- Data coverage information (time spans, record counts)

## Self-Test Verification

Run the comprehensive self-test to verify system health:

```bash
python scripts/self_test.py
```

This checks:
- Environment variables and package availability
- Directory structure and permissions
- Configuration file validity
- Feature consumer functionality
- Feature ingestor instantiation
- Current hour summary existence
- Bazaar data source availability

## Sample Data Generation

For testing without live data:

```bash
python scripts/generate_sample_data.py
```

Creates realistic sample data:
- Feature summaries for common items over 6 hours
- Bazaar price/volume data over 3 hours  
- NDJSON snapshot fallback data

## Production Deployment

1. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   echo "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_actual_token" > .env
   echo "HYPIXEL_API_KEY=your_actual_key" >> .env
   ```

2. **Start the system**:
   ```bash
   ./start_bot.sh
   ```

3. **Verify operation**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/self_test.py
   ```

4. **Test commands in Discord**:
   - `/plot item:WHEAT hours:3`
   - `/market_pulse hours:2`
   - `/analyze item:EMERALD`
   - `/diag_features`

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Within 3 minutes**: Current-hour parquet summary exists after ingestor start  
✅ **FeatureConsumer**: Logs show ≥1 files loaded for analysis window  
✅ **Robust /plot**: Returns charts with coverage info or detailed error messages  
✅ **Market Pulse**: Returns actionable signals from latest data  
✅ **Enhanced /analyze**: Comprehensive stats with z-scores and insights  
✅ **Diagnostics**: Reports healthy file counts and timestamps  
✅ **Environment**: Proper .env loading for background processes  

## Monitoring

Watch these indicators for healthy operation:

- Feature summaries appearing in `data/feature_summaries/year=/month=/day=/hour=/`
- FeatureConsumer logs showing successful data loading
- AuctionSniper logs showing non-zero watchlist counts
- Plot commands returning charts with market statistics
- Market pulse showing recent signals
- Diagnostics commands reporting healthy status

The enhanced pipeline now provides robust, production-ready market intelligence with comprehensive error handling and diagnostics.
